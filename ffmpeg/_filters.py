            Otherwise, just draw the text exactly as given. By default 1 (if supported).
        ft_load_flags: The flags to be used for loading the fonts. The flags map the

            characters. This parameter is mandatory if no file is specified with the
            parameter textfile.
        textfile: A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be a sequence
            of UTF-8 encoded characters.  This parameter is mandatory if no text string
            is specified with the parameter text.  If both text and textfile are
            specified, an error is thrown.
        reload: If set to 1, the textfile will be reloaded before each frame. Be sure
            to update it atomically, or it may be read partially, or even fail.

        - vsub: vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format
          "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.
        - line_h: the height of each text line
        - lh: Alias for ``line_h``.
        - main_h: the input height
        - h: Alias for ``main_h``.

        - ascent: the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
          coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.
          It is a positive value, due to the grid's orientation with the Y axis
          upwards.
        - max_glyph_a: Alias for ``ascent``.
        - descent: the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid
          coordinate used to place a glyph outline
          point, for all the rendered glyphs. This is a negative value, due to the
          grid's orientation, with the Y axis upwards.
        - max_glyph_d: Alias for ``descent``.
        - max_glyph_h: maximum glyph height, that is the maximum height for all the
          glyphs contained in the rendered text, it is equivalent to ascent - descent.
        - max_glyph_w: maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all the
          glyphs contained in the rendered text.
        - n: the number of input frame, starting from 0
        - rand(min, max): return a random number included between min and max
        - sar: The input sample aspect ratio.
        - t: timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown
        - text_h: the height of the rendered text
        - th: Alias for ``text_h``.
        - text_w: the width of the rendered text
        - tw: Alias for ``text_w``.
        - x: the x offset coordinates where the text is drawn.
        - y: the y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

        These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer each other, so you can
        for example specify ``y=x/dar``.
