## Overview

There are tons of Python FFmpeg wrappers out there but they seem to lack complex filter support.  `ffmpeg-python` works well for simple as well as complex signal graphs.


## Quickstart

Flip a video horizontally:
```python
import ffmpeg
stream = ffmpeg.input('input.mp4')
stream = ffmpeg.hflip(stream)
stream = ffmpeg.output(stream, 'output.mp4')
ffmpeg.run(stream)
```

Or if you prefer a fluent interface:
```python
import ffmpeg
(
    ffmpeg
    .input('input.mp4')
    .hflip()
    .output('output.mp4')
    .run()
)
```

## Complex filter graphs
FFmpeg is extremely powerful, but its command-line interface gets really complicated rather quickly - especially when working with signal graphs and doing anything more than trivial.

Take for example a signal graph that looks like this:

![Signal graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/master/doc/graph1.png)

The corresponding command-line arguments are pretty gnarly:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i overlay.png -filter_complex "[0]trim=start_frame=10:end_frame=20[v0];\
    [0]trim=start_frame=30:end_frame=40[v1];[v0][v1]concat=n=2[v2];[1]hflip[v3];\
    [v2][v3]overlay=eof_action=repeat[v4];[v4]drawbox=50:50:120:120:red:t=5[v5]"\
    -map [v5] output.mp4
```

Maybe this looks great to you, but if you're not an FFmpeg command-line expert, it probably looks alien.

If you're like me and find Python to be powerful and readable, it's easier with `ffmpeg-python`:
```python
import ffmpeg

in_file = ffmpeg.input('input.mp4')
overlay_file = ffmpeg.input('overlay.png')
(
    ffmpeg
    .concat(
        in_file.trim(start_frame=10, end_frame=20),
        in_file.trim(start_frame=30, end_frame=40),
    )
    .overlay(overlay_file.hflip())
    .drawbox(50, 50, 120, 120, color='red', thickness=5)
    .output('out.mp4')
    .run()
)
```

`ffmpeg-python` takes care of running `ffmpeg` with the command-line arguments that correspond to the above filter diagram, in familiar Python terms.

Real-world signal graphs can get a heck of a lot more complex, but `ffmpeg-python` handles arbitrarily large (directed-acyclic) signal graphs.

## Installation

The latest version of `ffmpeg-python` can be acquired via a typical pip install:

```
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

Or the source can be cloned and installed from locally:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kkroening/ffmpeg-python.git
pip install -e ./ffmpeg-python
```

## Custom Filters

Don't see the filter you're looking for?  While `ffmpeg-python` includes shorthand notation for some of the most commonly used filters (such as `concat`), all filters can be referenced via the `.filter` operator:
```python
stream = ffmpeg.input('dummy.mp4')
stream = ffmpeg.filter(stream, 'fps', fps=25, round='up')
stream = ffmpeg.output(stream, 'dummy2.mp4')
ffmpeg.run(stream)
```

Or fluently:
```python
(
    ffmpeg
    .input('dummy.mp4')
    .filter('fps', fps=25, round='up')
    .output('dummy2.mp4')
    .run()
)
```

**Special option names:**

Arguments with special names such as `-qscale:v` (variable bitrate), `-b:v` (constant bitrate), etc. can be specified as a keyword-args dictionary as follows:
```python
(
    ffmpeg
    .input('in.mp4')
    .output('out.mp4', **{'qscale:v': 3})
    .run()
)
```

**Multiple inputs:**

Filters that take multiple input streams can be used by passing the input streams as an array to `ffmpeg.filter`:
```python
main = ffmpeg.input('main.mp4')
logo = ffmpeg.input('logo.png')
(
    ffmpeg
    .filter([main, logo], 'overlay', 10, 10)
    .output('out.mp4')
    .run()
)
```

**Multiple outputs:**

Filters that produce multiple outputs can be used with `.filter_multi_output`:
```python
split = (
    ffmpeg
    .input('in.mp4')
    .filter_multi_output('split')  # or `.split()`
)
(
    ffmpeg
    .concat(split[0], split[1].reverse())
    .output('out.mp4')
    .run()
)
```
(In this particular case, `.split()` is the equivalent shorthand, but the general approach works for other multi-output filters)

**String expressions:**

Expressions to be interpreted by ffmpeg can be included as string parameters and reference any special ffmpeg variable names:
```python
(
    ffmpeg
    .input('in.mp4')
    .filter('crop', 'in_w-2*10', 'in_h-2*20')
    .input('out.mp4')
)
```

When in doubt, refer to the [existing filters](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/blob/master/ffmpeg/_filters.py), [examples](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/tree/master/examples), and/or the [official ffmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html).

## Frequently asked questions

**Why do I get an import/attribute/etc. error from `import ffmpeg`?**

Make sure you ran `pip install ffmpeg-python` and not `pip install ffmpeg` or `pip install python-ffmpeg`.

**Why did my audio stream get dropped?**

Some ffmpeg filters drop audio streams, and care must be taken to preserve the audio in the final output.  The ``.audio`` and ``.video`` operators can be used to reference the audio/video portions of a stream so that they can be processed separately and then re-combined later in the pipeline.

This dilemma is intrinsic to ffmpeg, and ffmpeg-python tries to stay out of the way while users may refer to the official ffmpeg documentation as to why certain filters drop audio.

As usual, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/tree/master/examples#audiovideo-pipeline) (*Audio/video pipeline* in particular).

**How can I find out the used command line arguments?**

You can run `stream.get_args()` before `stream.run()` to retrieve the command line arguments that will be passed to `ffmpeg`. You can also run `stream.compile()` that also includes the `ffmpeg` executable as the first argument.

**How do I do XYZ?**

Take a look at each of the links in the [Additional Resources](https://kkroening.github.io/ffmpeg-python/) section at the end of this README.  If you look everywhere and can't find what you're looking for and have a question that may be relevant to other users, you may open an issue asking how to do it, while providing a thorough explanation of what you're trying to do and what you've tried so far.

Issues not directly related to `ffmpeg-python` or issues asking others to write your code for you or how to do the work of solving a complex signal processing problem for you that's not relevant to other users will be closed.

That said, we hope to continue improving our documentation and provide a community of support for people using `ffmpeg-python` to do cool and exciting things.
